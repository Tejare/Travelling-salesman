# Travelling-salesman		  ADS Project
Topic – Travelling Salesman Problem
Travelling Salesman Problem is used to find the shortest path in a weighted graph . We have to find the shortest path by starting and ending at the same point.
In this project we have used two algorithms to solve the TSP :- 

1)	Greedy Algorithm and

2)	Brute Force Algorithm (back tracking)

And compared the solutions provided by the algorithms .

1)	Greedy Algorithm – It is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the intent of finding a global optimum.

2)	Brute Force Algorithm - is a very general problem-solving technique and algorithmic paradigm that consists of systematically enumerating all possible candidates for the solution and checking whether each candidate satisfies the problem's statement.

From the above project we have concluded that despite of having a better time complexity as compared to Brute Force Algorithm Greedy Algorithm is unable to provide the optimal solution whereas the Brute Force Algorithm always comes up with the optimal solution.
